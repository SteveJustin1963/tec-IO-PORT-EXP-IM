TEC-1 32 Port Select Expansion daughter board


- Ian McLean
- 32 Port Expansion for TEC-1 daughter board
- This is my proposed circuit - just a stock standard use of 138 decoders and 1/2 of a 139 decoder for building a larger decoder as per datasheet spec.
- Why so many ports? 
- Answer one - Why not?! 
- Answer two - because I would like to build a 16x8 display (or larger) with every LED individually addressable and latch-able 
- i.e. no multiplexing required, and therefore a much much easier display to drive, 
- and consequently a display with even brightness on all LEDs.
- A 16x8 will require 16 ports.
- Yes I know I could use a modern LED matrix driver chip and save all those latches (and ports), 
- but I am going old-school, and trying this out instead.
- There's a reason I love GALs/CPLDs...
- Paul Antoine Great option. 
- Any suggestions for a suitable chip? 
- This would be a great CPLD learning project an easy project at that. 
- I don't have any experience outside of the 16V8/20V8 and 22V10 GALs, neither of which are large enough to make a 5 to‚Ä¶
- Mark Jelic, Ian McLean that is going to be an expensive display!
- You know what I reckon would be interesting to make: an LED display circuit that has its own scan routine without having the CPU involved. 
- Would need some way to read the data (in your case, 16 bytes) while the CPU can still write data to that same 8 bytes...
- Ooh, just had a thought! TWO sets of 16 bytes that as far as the CPU is concerned, writes to one location, 
- but in fact writes to bank A. 
- When the CPU finishes writing (CE off) a latch flips so that the next time data is written it is going to bank B. 
- Meanwhile the video processor is multiplexing the data in Bank A!! 
- When data is written next time to bank B, video loop uses data from B. Bam!!
- I bet there is an official name for this idea and some historic smarty pants will say ‚ÄúDer, that‚Äôs how blah blah video works!‚Äù... 
- yeah well, I just came up with this idea right here right now! 
- No patent infringement possible and I give the idea out to the open! Sue me! üòÇ
- Ian McLean, Mark Jelic Expensive is a relative thing these days. 
- I just ordered 8 x 74LS273 chips from Element14 (yes they still have them!) for $1.43 each. 
- Yes, so 16 of these will be about $23 to build such a display.
- With parts so cheap these days, it tempts me‚Ä¶ 
- Mark Jelic Ian McLean I on the other hand want to make a display... saaaay... a 24x16 (made out of six of those little 8x8 modules)...
- Ian McLean All said and done, 
- regardless of how I end up driving the LED display, there is still no harm in decoding 32 ports on the TEC - 
- Ian McLean Mark Jelic I think displays this big, 24x16 or bigger and you are into shift register territory, as Andrew McMeikan below has suggested. 
- I believe this is the way many commercial displays are done or at least prior to dedicated LED matrix driver chips ‚Ä¶ 
- Mark Jelic Ian McLean Please explain! 
- I know what a shift register is, but how do you use one when making displays?
- Andrew McMeikan There are shift registers dedicated for leds. 
- Then you just have one resistor to set the current. 
- Otherwise just use outputs as you would a latch. 
- I have done this for a living so I can give you some pointers, I will have to avoid giving out specifics.
- Mark Jelic Andrew McMeikan are you talking about a serial to parallel shift register?
- Andrew McMeikan Mark, yep, like the hc595. I used to use mbi chips, but there are many to choose from.
- Paul Antoine 595s are really easy to work with in my experience...
- Andrew McMeikan Shift register would be better, a lot easier to expand
